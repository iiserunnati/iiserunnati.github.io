										Team Unnati would like to express its heartfelt gratitude to the students, faculty and other staff members of IISER Tirupati for their generous contribution towards its first Clothes Donation drive intended to benefit students in government schools near our institute. <br>
 
We are glad to inform you that the 6 big boxes of clothes collected were donated to the Annaswamipalli School near our institute on 15th August 2019 on the wonderful occasion of India's 73rd Independence Day. <br>
 
The happiness and enthusiasm of the kids for celebrating the Independence Day at their school was a sight to behold. What was even more heart-warming to witness was their curiosity and excitement on seeing us. <br><br>
 
We are extremely greatful for your overwhelming response for this initiative.

										Science Quiz <br><br>

Unnati has been conducting quiz competitions for school students for 3 consecutive years now. Conducted in January or February in association with the Science day celebrations at the institute, the quiz has seen active participation from various schools in the locality over the years. Students were invited in teams from classes 9 and 10 and were quizzed on subjects ranging from science, math to general awareness. The winners were awarded certificates and felicitated. The students were also given a brief look into the labs to ignite their curiosity in the kind of work that goes on in the institute.
